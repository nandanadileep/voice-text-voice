# voice-text-voice

Overview
Voice-Text-Voice enables natural spoken interaction with an AI assistant:
Speech-to-Text (STT) — Capture and transcribe user’s voice input.
Backend NLP — Process transcribed text with a language model or chat logic.
Text-to-Speech (TTS) — Synthesize spoken responses from the generated reply.
This loop creates a seamless voice → text → voice conversational flow, ideal for voice assistants, accessibility tools, and interactive voice applications.
